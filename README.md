# Countdown Timer [No-RTC]

This project involves creating a countdown timer using an Arduino Uno, an LCD screen, a joystick, and a buzzer. The purpose is to enable the user to set and start a countdown timer using the joystick, with the remaining time displayed on the LCD. Upon completion, a buzzer alerts the user. The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to achieve a functional countdown timer.

**Tech:** C++, Arduino IDE, Fritzing.


## Projcet Design

This project uses the following components:

- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Screen
- Buzzer
- Joystick Module
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- 10k Potentiometer
The system architecture includes connecting the LCD to the Arduino for display, the joystick for input, and the buzzer for alerts. The user sets the countdown time using the joystick, and the timer logic is implemented in the Arduino code.
